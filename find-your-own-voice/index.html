            Welcome!

            On this site you'll find a collection of books that reflect the experiences of people from many different backgrounds.

            <h3>Some of the characters (both real and imagined) in these books are extraordinary: they save lives, fight oppression, and overcome huge obstacles.  Some of the characters are ordinary: they fight with their siblings, complain about their parents, and go to school.  Many of the characters are both.</h3>

            <p>Use this wiki to find books about all kinds of people (people of color, people from diverse cultures and backgrounds, people from different religious traditions, people with varying abilities, and people whose gender and sexuality have been marginalized) doing both ordinary and extraordinary things.  We hope that you'll browse our selections with an open mind and eager heart.</p>
            
            <p>For a detailed description of how these books were selected,please visit our Evaluation Criteria page.  Visit the References page for a complete list of the resources used to develop this wiki.</p>

            <p>Best,</p>
