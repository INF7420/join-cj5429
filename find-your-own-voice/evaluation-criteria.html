            The books included in this wiki reflect careful curation and evaluation based on the following criteria:
        </p>

        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <b>Books should include authentic representations of culture(s), beliefs, abilities, and experiences.</b> Most of the books we selected for this wiki represent authors who belong to the groups they write about.  Even when writing fiction, authors' experiences in underrepresented communities enable them to write about those experiences using first-hand knowledge.  As indicated thoroughout the wiki, the #ownvoices hashtag informed our selection of these texts.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Books should accurately reflect the experiences, historical events, language, and practices of the people, time period, and geographic location represented in the text.</b> In the rare instances that we included books written by someone who was not a member of the marginalized group about which they were writing, we were careful to include books written by authors who were experts and/or had done extensive research (referenced in their books) on the topics about which they were writing.  Inclusion of extensive references and additional historical information, as well as affirmation and/or corroboration from the represented group(s) were the indicators we used to identify the accuracy of the books we chose.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Books should include realistic and in-depth portrayals of characters/subjects from or topics relating to marginalized communities.</b> For fiction, we were intentional about selecting books that included multi-dimension characters that grow and change over the course of the narrative.  Our books avoid characters that are flat and underdeveloped and only serve as plot devices or to make a book more diverse.  For our biography selections, we were careful to include texts that give thorough insight into people from underrepresented communities, including both their strengths and weaknesses. 
                </li> 
                <li>
                    <b>Books should include illustrations that further the text and avoid stereotypes.</b> The illustrations included in the diverse texts we selected are often drawn by people who are part of the communities represented in those illustrations.  The illustrations extend the content of the words, often revealing information that cannot be gleaned from the text alone.  The art in these texts also avoids racial, ethnic, ableist, gender, and sexual stereotypes.  This includes ensuring that visual representation makes clear that not all members of the same marginalized group look the same. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Books should employ high-quality writing.</b>  Books that tell the stories of underrepresented communities without quality writing are a disservice to those communities.  Diverse readers deserve to see themselves represented in writing that is engaging and polished and that employs wide-ranging and sophisticated literary and rhetorical devices.
                </li>
            </ol>
