# My Portfolio Website

Moving forward using my skills acquired from INF 7420, I am going to create a portfolio website to showcase my MLIS work. I will include work from SIS courses as well as work that I do in my teaching career that I find relevant.

## Wireframes

![Wireframe of Landing Page](images/wireframes-01.jpg)

The landing page will have a banner header, navigation menu, welcome message, some featured documents/images, feeds from social media, and a footer with copyright.

![Wireframe of Reading List Page](images/wireframes-02.jpg)

The Reading List Page will have the same header/footer, but the body will have 3 blocked images of book covers--just finished, currently reading next up--and will eventually have some Javascript/animation incorporated to give the reader more information. For example, a review for just finished, an impression for currently reading, and a why-I'm-interested for next up. 

![Wireframe of Teaching and Library Materials Pages](images/wireframes-03.jpg)

These pages will be set up similarly with the same header and footer, but the space on the sides will have a few book covers as decoration for the page. The body will include links to teaching materials, unit and lesson plans, and links to projects from my MLIS coursework.

![Wireframe of About and Contact Pages](images/wireframes-04.jpg)

These two pages will have the same header and footer as the previous pages. On the About page, there will be some images of me, a brief biography, and my credentials. On the contact page, there will be a contact form smiliar to that on the RCSD Media Centers contact page, but without a phone number space and no checkboxes.
