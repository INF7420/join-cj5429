# My Portfolio Website

Moving forward using my skills acquired from INF 7420, I am going to create a portfolio website to showcase my MLIS work. I will include work from SIS courses as well as work that I do in my teaching career that I find relevant.

## Wireframes

Eventually I'll create some wireframes for this. Depends on how many snow days I have this week, haha.
