# My INF7420 Project

I am going to build a website for my school district's media centers. I was recently hired in Riverview and I want to create a website to showcase the work and programming the media centers are doing to serve our school district.

## Wireframes

Here are my general, envisioned wireframes that show how I plan to lay the website out.
